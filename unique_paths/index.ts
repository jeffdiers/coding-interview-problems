// Problem: Unique Paths

// Description:

// A robot is located at the top-left corner of an m x n grid.
// It can only move either down or right at any point in time.
// The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid.

// How many unique paths are there?

// Input:
// m and n are positive integers, where m represents the number of
// rows and n represents the number of columns in the grid.

// Output:
// Return the number of unique paths the robot can take to reach
// the bottom-right corner.

export const uniquePaths = (n: number, m: number) => {
  // Your code here
};

// Example
console.log(uniquePaths(3, 7)); // Should return 28
